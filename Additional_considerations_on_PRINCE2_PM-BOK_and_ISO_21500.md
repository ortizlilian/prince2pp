# Additional considerations on PRINCE2, PM-BOK, and ISO 21500

## PRINCE2

Projects in a Controlled Environment (PRINCE2TM) is a structured process-based method for project management. Its premises derive from the experience acquired through the execution of a massive number of projects, whose information comes from the contributions of thousands of project-related professionals (Axelos, 2017).
PRINCE2 is composed of principles, themes, and processes (Axelos, 2017), as listed below:

* Principles: Continuous business justification, learn from experience, define roles and responsibilities, manage by stages, manage by exception, focus on products, and tailor to suit the project environment.
* Themes: Business Case, organization, quality, plans, risk, change, and progress.
* Processes: Starting up a Project, Directing a Project, Initiating a Project, Controlling a Stage, Managing Product Delivery, Managing a Stage Boundary, and Closing a Project.

All of these combined, consolidate PRINCE2 as a methodology that guides the project in a global way, from its beginning, with the idealization of the project and verification of its viability, until its closure. Monitoring, control, and frequent reviews are carried out continuously throughout the execution of the project (Axelos, 2017).

## PMBOK

Unlike PRINCE2, a methodology that dictates how to do things, PMBOK® (Project Management Body of Knowledge) is rather a standard, that is, a framework or knowledge base that helps the user to understand what to do in order to successfully manage projects (Schwalbe, 2019).
The PMBOK Guide indicates good practices for project management, but its guidelines should not be strictly followed, rather they should be adapted to the project that the guide user is managing, after all, each project has its own specificities, being always different from the others (Project Management Institute, 2017).
With regard to the processes involved in project management, PMBOK considers only five groups (in contrast to PRINCE2, which understands the existence of 7 processes). The groups (Project Management Institute, 2017) are:

* Initiating
* Planning
* Executing
* Monitoring and Controlling
* Closing

Additionally, the PMBOK divides the project management area into 10 fundamental sub-areas, which should be observed throughout the project lifecycle (Project Management Institute, 2017). The 10 sub-areas stated by PMBOK are:

* Project Integration Management
* Project Scope Management
* Project Time Management
* Project Cost Management
* Project Quality Management
* Project Human Resource Management
* Project Communications Management
* Project Risk Management
* Project Procurement Management
* Project Stakeholder Management

Ultimately it is possible to note a similarity between the defined areas of knowledge by PMBOK with the themes established by PRINCE2.

## ISO 21500

ISO 21500, is a standard issued by the International Organization for Standardization, which offers guidance in project management. The instructions and best practices contained in ISO 21500 were inspired by the PMBOK (Varajão, Colomo-Palacios, and Silva, 2016).
Despite the similarities between PMBOK and ISO 21500, the latter does not offer a detailed explanation of the project management tools and techniques, as it is done by PMBOK (Varajão, Colomo-Palacios, and Silva, 2016). It is worth mentioning that ISO 21500 has only 47 pages, though.
