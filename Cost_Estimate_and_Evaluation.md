# Cost Estimate and Evaluation

This session is intended to estimate the cost of the project development, as well as an evaluation of its benefits, both financially and in terms of improving the company image and expanding its operations.

## Project Cost Estimate

To produce a cost estimate of the proposed project, the bottom-up estimation method will be used. According to Schwalbe (2019), the bottom-up estimate works by calculating the costs of each singular portion of the system and then adding these individual values to obtain the final cost of the project.
Hughes (2019) says that this approach is recommended when there are still no historical records of former projects similar to the one that is being estimated. Knowing that the proposed project refers to creating an e-commerce website from scratch, Bottom-up estimating method seems highly suitable for this particular project.
[Figure 1](https://github.com/ortizlilian/prince2pp/blob/main/Appendices.md) shows the Product Breakdown Structure[^1] of this project, as well as the number of iterations necessary to develop each sub-item of the final product. This PBS will be the basis for calculating hours of work of each team member dedicated to developing e-commerce.
The table below shows the professionals responsible for building the e-commerce, their likely assigned tasks and the respective development times. The end result is the total cost to be spent on personnel.

| Roles | Activities | Hours | Hour rate | Total Cost |
| ----- | ---------- | ----- | --------- | ---------- |
| Web Designer | Designing Front End | 96 | £ 17.04 | £ 1,635.84 |
| Full Stack Developer | Developing Front End | 96 | £ 27.91 | £ 2,679.36 |
| Back End Developer | Developing Components | 256 | £ 33.85 | £ 8,665.60 |
| DevOps | Building Web Server, Database & Reports | 192 | £ 25.16 | £ 4,830.72 |
| Tester | Testing M&L E-commerce | 160 | £ 16.38 | £ 2,620.80 | 
| Design TM[^3] | Managing project deliverables | 80 | £ 21.26 | £ 1,700.80 |
| Development TM | Managing project deliverables | 80 | £ 27.37 | £ 2,189.60 |
| QA[^4] TM | Managing project deliverables | 80 | £ 25.21 | £ 2,016.80 |
| Project Manager | Managing Project | 800 | £ 30.57 | £ 24,456.00 | 

### Totals
- Hours: 1840
- Hour Rate: £ 224.75
- Total Cost: £ 50,795.52

It is worth clarifying the following points regarding this table:
- One of the principles of XP is the “40-hour week”. This methodology does not welcome the practice of overworking (Beck; Andres, 2004). Therefore, each iteration is equivalent to 80 hours of work by the team member (it is assumed that all personnel assigned to the production of the e-commerce are dedicated exclusively to this project).
- For the production of front end a rate of 4:4:2 work-hours is assumed. This is equivalent to saying that 40% of iteration duration corresponds to Full Stack Developer working hours, 40% of Web Designer and 20% of Tester.
- To calculate the hourly rate, information available on Glassdoor platform on the average annual salary of professionals in the London area was used. It is assumed that 1 year has 1,920 work-hours.
- Team Managers' dedication to this particular project will represent 10% of the total iteration time.
- 20% of each iteration duration is assigned to Tester's activities.

A second category of costs for this specific project alludes to IT Resources needed to build an e-commerce. This project suggests the use of cloud based services to set the database, the back end components, as well as the cost of hiring an external service for generating management reports.
The table below expresses the IT Resources cost estimate provided by Amazon Web Services:

| IT Resource | Monthly Cost | Total Cost[^5] |
| ----------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| MySQL Database | £ 83.82 | £ 419.10 |
| Simple Storage Service | £ 69.00 | £ 345.00 | 
| 4 Lambda Functions | £ 98.66 | £ 493.30 |
| Elastic Search (Kibana) | £ 248.27 | £1,241.35 |
| **Totals** | £ 499.75 | £ 2,498.75 |

The third category of relevant costs involves expenditure on office space, utility bills and the likes. According to Furmanik (2019) the average cost of rent per desk in the region of Docklands, London is £ 600/month. To this amount, an additional 30% will be added, which represents expenses with utility bills and the likes. The table below illustrates the expenses mentioned:

| Cost Origin | Monthly cost[^6] | Total Cost |
| ----------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Desk | £ 6,000 | £ 30,000 |
| Utilities | £ 1,800 | £ 9,000 |
| Totals | £ 7,800 | £ 39,000 |

Finally, based on all those estimated costs, the total project cost will be **£ 92,294.27**.

## Project Evaluation

An essential part of deciding on the feasibility of starting a new project is the evaluation of its costs in comparison with its potential benefits. This evaluation process is known as Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) and its application is highly recommended during the phase when it is being decided whether it is worth it to pursue a proposed project (Weller, 2016).
To perform a CBA it is important to follow 5 steps: define the parameters of the analysis, categorize costs and benefits by type, calculate the costs and benefits over the project-lifetime, compare costs and benefits and finally use the results to make the final decision on the implementation of the project (Weller, 2016).
Although an analysis that encompasses all 5 steps is more effective, for this particular project an simpler analysis will be carried out (it is due to the lack of information about the company and the project itself), and it will compare the potential increase in profits generated by the launch of an online store, in comparison with the cost estimate of the project issued previously.
According to a study by the Center of Retail Research, 76.9% of the UK population made at least one online purchase at retail stores in 2020. Another study by NatWest and Retail Economics (2021) showed that 28% of the total sales within the Retail sector throughout 2020, was made online.
The following table shows a possible projection of the increase in M&L Stores plc annual sales revenue, once it starts to perform online sales, thus capturing the 28% of the sector's share of sales made over the internet, and contrasts the increase with this particular project costs.

### M&L E-commerce
- Estimated cost of the project: £ 92,294.27
- Potential Revenue from Online Sales in a year: £ 1.057 billion[^7]
- Potential Revenue from Online Sales in a month: £ 88.153 millions
- Project Cost vs Potential Revenue Earned in a month (%): 0.10%

The above projection confirms the positive impact that this project is likely to have on M & L's revenue. It is noted that project costs will count as only 0.10% of the projected monthly earnings of potential new sales completed online.
According to Smale (2015), among the advantages of starting an e-commerce are the possibility of maintaining a sales channel at impractical times for street shops (between 11pm - 6am), launching a website, in terms, is simpler than building a physical store, and approximately 80% of web users have already purchased online.
Therefore, bearing in mind all the advantages here presented  that this project is likely to produce, its viability has been solidly justified.

[^1]: The project breakdown structure (PBS) is a graphical representation of a given project product elements. In order to produce a PBS, the initial plan is broken down successively into increasingly smaller components. Thus, reaching a level of detail of the initial product that did not exist before (Axelos, 2017).
[^2]: Hours worked on the project.
[^3]: Team Manager.
[^4]: Quality Assurance.
[^5]: 5 months of use, which is equivalent to the development time of the e-commerce.
[^6]: In this case, a team of 10 people (9 LOC Softwares Inc employees and 1 client representative) is being considered, therefore 10 desks.
[^7]: This value was inspired by the annual sales revenue of John Lewis in the UK. According to John Lewis Partnership plc 2021 Annual Report (2021), the company had a turnover of £ 3,778 billion in 2020 . The figure shown in the table refers to 28% of online sales, as mentioned in the previous paragraph.
