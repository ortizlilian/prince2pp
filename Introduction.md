# Introduction

## Project Summary

M&L Stores Plc has established itself as a major British retail company. It currently has 70 department stores spread across Great Britain. Among its expansion plans, it intends to extend its operations internationally.
In order to create an online presence, M&L Stores plc hired LOC Software Inc[^1] services. This document is a rough Project Plan written in order to guide the development of the information system whose purpose is to expand M&L’s operations beyond high street retailing realm, by launching an online store.

## Comparative of Methods

When hiring the services of LOC Softwares Inc, the executives of M&L Stores determined the use of the PRINCE2 methodology for the management of the project itself, since that was the methodology chosen to guide the execution of other projects parallel to this one.
However, with regard to the software development method to be employed on the production of the project final product, the M&L executive committee did not show any specific preference.
Thus, in order to justify the chosen software methodology (which will be informed at the end of this session) the table below was produced. The table, in turn, lists the features of this project and establishes a comparison between two different software development methods, based on how they would deal with each of the different project features.

| Project Feature | SDM 1 - XP[^2] | SDM 2 - RUP®[^3] |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| The project proposes the development of a web based system from scratch; | XP is part of the so-called agile methodologies, which seek to mobilize more resources in the implementation of a system than in its documentation, making them lighter and more resilient to changes (Layton, Ostermiller and Kynaston, 2020). Software developed from scratch tends to be more unpredictable due to its novelty, hence an agile methodology such as XP is perfectly suited to project feature number 1. | One of RUP's 6 Best Practices, namely Manage Requirements, attaches great importance to eliciting, organizing tasks and documenting requirements. This serves the purpose of producing software that meets customer expectations (Anwar, 2014). Bearing in mind that the web based software requested by M&L will be created from scratch, it is useful to produce documentation that records the requirements that guided its production, hence RUP complies with feature 1. |
| The client showed an inclination to make changes to the system as it is being developed; | With the advent of fast deliveries, which allows constant feedback from stakeholders (Wells, 2013), XP is perfectly suited to feature 2, since the customer does not yet have a solid idea of how the system should look like at the end of the project, showing interest in keeping open the possibility of changing it during development. | RUP operates through small iterations, usually equivalent to 1-2 weeks, when small parts of the system are developed. This prevents changes in requirements from having a negative impact on the development process, since they will either be carried out within the next iteration or, if they are part of the current iteration, they would be small enough to not affect the work already done (Anwar, 2014). Therefore, RUP handles the requirements of feature number 2 very well. |
| The client emphasized the interest in having an executable version of the system ASAP; | In order to comply with the ‘constant feedback’ value, XP develops functional parts of the software from the beginning, allowing the client to assess whether the version presented is in accordance with their expectations (Beck; Andres, 2004). Consequently, once XP is adopted to develop this particular project, M&L is sure to get a functional version of the software required as soon as a first release is issued. | For software developed under the RUP methodology to reflect customer expectations correctly, this methodology seeks regular feedback from customers at each portion of software produced, at the end of each iteration (Mrsic, 2017). Therefore, it is perfectly possible to issue a release of a functional version of the website within 2 months (approximately 4-8 RUP iterations). |
| The client highlighted the importance of delivering the project within the 6-month period; | XP follows the “Simple Design” maxim, which means producing light, efficient and low-cost code. In order to do that, the developer focuses on producing a system that only meets current requirements, new features can always be added in the future. This simplicity in development allows the production of systems that live up to customer expectations within tights deadlines (Layton, Ostermiller and Kynaston, 2020). | RUP was born in 1981 from an initiative to unify software development methodologies, in order to make systems creation more disciplined, thus producing high-quality results within a predictable budget and schedule (Anwar, 2014). Considering the importance given by the customer to the deadline, RUP seems to be an adequate methodology for this particular project. |
| A customer representative will be allocated to work with the development team; | One of the 12 XP practices emphasizes frequent customer participation during the software development process, so that they can clarify any doubts that may arise during the construction of the system (Beck; Andres, 2004). Thus, the presence of the customer representative in the LOC Software Inc premises confirms the suitability of XP for this project. | Although the RUP method values ​​customer feedback, there is no need for their presence within the development office environment, given that software requirements are methodically documented during the first phase of a project (Lambertsen, 2002). Therefore, feature 5 does not represent anything fundamental to apply RUP methodology. |

Based on the analysis issued above, it is possible to conclude that the method most suitable for this project is XP - eXtreme Programming. Although RUP meets almost perfectly the majority of project features listed in the table, it is still a complex methodology and may require a little more dedication on the part of team members for their learning. 
In contrast, XP is a lightweight method, largely based on communication between software developers and stakeholders. When the client assigns one of its employees to work together with the developers and does not mention anything about the need for producing documentation of the software, it is understood that continuous communication is more valued than the formality of written records, hence XP seems to be the best software development methodology for this particular project.

[^1]: LOC Softwares Inc is a hypothetical name attributed to the large software development company, located in the Docklands in London, which will produce the system requested by M&L Stores plc. LOC stands for Lilian Ortiz Costa.
[^2]: Extreme Programming is an agile software development methodology for small and medium-sized teams that develop software based on vague requirements that may change frequently. This methodology is based on four values: communication, simplicity, feedback and courage (Beck; Andres, 2004).
[^3]: Rational Unified ProcessⓇ is a software development methodology that operates by iterations and aims to deliver quality software through a disciplined approach that focuses on defining the tasks and responsibilities of each member of the team. (Anwar, 2014).
