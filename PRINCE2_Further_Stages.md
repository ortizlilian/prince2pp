# PRINCE2 Further Stages

## Initiation Stage

At this stage a detailed plan for the execution of the project is produced, the funds to back the project are made available and control guidelines are defined so that the project runs according to the client's expectations (Axelos, 2017).
During this stage, the Initiating a Project, Managing Stage Boundary and Directing a Project processes are performed. The latter, in turn, continues to be carried out until the end of the project (Axelos, 2017).
M&L E-commerce project initiation stage will involve the collection of more information about the M&L Stores plc detailed motivations of establishing an online presence, since the information collected so far is not yet enough to produce a robust Project Initiation Document. 
After sufficient information about the company and its interests has been collected an improved version of Project Initiation Documents will be produced and reviewed by the Project Board for a final decision on project authorization.

## Subsequent Delivery Stages

This is the stage at which the Project Board gives the Project Manager daily basis control over the stages of the project. The Project Manager begins to specify work to be carried out, monitors whether deliverables are in accordance with project requirements and whether the project progress corresponds to the timeline foreseen in the initial planning. Additionally, PM seeks approval where it is needed (Axelos, 2017).
The processes that integrate this stage are: Controlling a Stage, Managing Product Delivery and Managing Stage Boundary. The Managing Product Delivery process involves Team Managers as they delegate the work package to their team members and keeps the Project Manager informed about the progress of the releases (Axelos, 2017).
The present project will initially involve 10 iterations with multiple products delivered at the end of each one. Section 4.2 “Gantt Chart and Deliverables” contains a detailed plan of the deliverables for each iteration. 

## Final Delivery Stage

This is the moment when project closure takes place. This stage consists of Controlling a Stage and Managing Product Delivery processes, as well as Closing a Project. The latter, in turn, aims to verify the acceptance by the delivered products users, as well as ensuring the existence of a structure to support the product after the end of the project. In addition, a performance review is done to assess how well the team performed during the execution of the project (Axelos, 2017).
The delivery of the e-commerce product of this project does not intend to mark the end of the partnership between M&L Stores plc and LOC Softwares Inc. At the end of the project, a personalized consulting services proposal to help with e-commerce matters will be offered to M&L Stores plc.
